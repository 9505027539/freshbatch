3. Use the functional interfaces Supplier, Consumer, Predicate & Function to invoke built-in methods from Java API.

4. Remove the words that have odd lengths from the list. HINT: Use one of the new methods from JDK 8. Use removeIf() method from Collection interface.

5. Create a string that consists of the first letter of each word in the list of Strings provided. HINT: Use Consumer interface & a StringBuilder to construct the result.

6. Replace every word in the list with its upper case equivalent. Use replaceAll() method & UnaryOperator interface.

7. Convert every key-value pair of the map into a string and append them all into a single string, in iteration order. HINT: Use Map.entrySet() method & a StringBuilder to construct the result String.

8. Create a new thread that prints the numbers from the list. Use class Thread & interface Consumer.



Setup:
